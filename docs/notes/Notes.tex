\section{Introduction}

This document is the outline of how the game engine functions.  It will discuess the graphics pipeline, each subsystem, external libraries, and tools that are used.

\subsection{Final Project Plans}

In this section we describe the overall goal of our engine and the basic minimum funtionality it can perform.

\section{Graphics Pipeline}

In this section we talk about the graphics pipeline.

\subsection{An example}

In this section describe {\bf in detail} from the start to the end how an object is rendered.
